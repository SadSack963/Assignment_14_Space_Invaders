# Space Invaders
### (Renamed from Space Monsters before release in 1978)

Oh my goodness, this project sent me on an epic journey. I have fond memories of playing the game myself in the Recreation Centre at the University College of Wales Aberystwyth when it was first released in the UK. 

The arcade machine was an immediate hit everywhere it went, and the under-glass table version was also popular in pubs as you could play it while the beer sat right next to you on the table.

I started this project by deciding to learn something new. I watched an excellent informative video on Pygame at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk. It's long at almost 4 hours but explains lots of things that would confuse a newbie in minute detail. Believe me, it's time well spent.

So I dove in and got the basic structure easily enough. I started with the player just to get something on the screen and prove that I was on the right track. After a couple of minor hiccups I had a player icon which could respond to key presses. 

This started me on a search for icons that I could use in my game, but everything I found was blurry anti-aliased, multi-coloured, different scales, etc. It was enough to get my code working, but I wanted better - much better. There are very few nice crisp bitmaps out there.

In the process of searching for images, I read a couple of emulation blogs. This one actually generated a character set https://www.ibbotson.co.uk/software/invaders/2020/12/22/space-invaders-charactermaps.html which I'm sure I'll find useful when I get to creating explosions! I also had a look at a real machine at https://www.gamesroomcompany.com/products/space-invaders-arcade-machine-by-midway, and some gameplay on the 1978 Taito: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdTyvod3zA8.

I was hooked. I don't think I'll be sweating blood over getting an exact emulation, but it would be nice to get as close as I can.

I also installed MAME https://www.mamedev.org/release.php, and got the emulation version of the game to help me https://www.romsformame.com/index.php?a=402. After all, it's been over 40 years since I last played it, and my memory isn't that good :)

Eventually I found Tomohiro Nishikado's original paper sketch of the aliens (!) at https://www.cookandbecker.com/en/article/326/space-invaders-five-unknown-facts.html, so of course I had to replicate this exactly for my game, and I faithfully copied them in GIMP.
